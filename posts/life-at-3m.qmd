## From Intern to Product Manager{.no-anchor}

> **5 ½ years · 3 roles · 1 constant goal:** keep the world’s smallest chips safe on their journey from fab to finished device.

I joined 3M’s **Electronics Material Solutions Division** as an intern, crunched marketing data as an analyst, and ultimately owned the **carrier-tape portfolio** as Product Manager. Along the way I learned how a millimeter-wide strip of plastic can make—or break—an entire semiconductor supply chain.


## Why Carrier Tape Matters{.no-anchor}

Carrier tape sits at the intersection of **precision engineering** and **high-volume automation**:

- **Protects** fragile dies, LEDs, passives from ESD & micro-cracks  
- **Feeds** pick-and-place machines at **> 30 k components/hr**  
- **Enables** wafer-level packaging, mini-LED TVs, and the chips in your phone

Without it, yield drops and production costs spike. Small tape, big impact.


## My Hats (Often Worn All at Once){.no-anchor}


| Area                       | What I Did                                                    | Outcome                         |
|----------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------|
| **Product Ownership**      | Drove roadmap for 3000 & 3200 Series tapes; scoped new pocket designs with R&D | Launched 2 SKUs → **+$4.2 M ARR** |
| **Market & Customer Analysis** | Built Power BI dashboard from SAP/CRM data to spot volume shifts | Identified mini-LED surge → **+18 % capacity** |
| **Cross-functional Coordination** | Ran weekly war-rooms with Sales, Ops, Quality | RFQ-to-ship lead-time **–20 %** |
| **Technical Support**      | Advised customers on peel-force & JEDEC specs | Secured top-3 smartphone OEM deal |
| **Go-to-Market**           | Created demo rigs & content for SEMICON, Productronica | Booth leads **+40 % YoY** |


## A Day in the (Tape-Filled) Life{.no-anchor}

1. **08:30** — Slack stand-up with manufacturing to triage a pocket-depth deviation.  
2. **10:00** — SQL pull on last quarter’s order mix → see LED segment up **12 %**.  
3. **13:00** — Customer call from Taiwan; debug peel-back static > 50 V.  
4. **15:00** — Figma mock of new datasheet; loop in MarCom for compliance.  
5. **17:00** — Update Jira epics, prep slides for exec read-out.

No two days looked alike—exactly why I loved it.{.no-anchor}



## Key Takeaways{.no-anchor}

- **Systems thinking wins.** A tape tweak can ripple through pick-&-place speed, yield, and cost.  
- **Data is a lingua franca.** Dashboards quelled debates and sped decisions.  
- **Partnerships > solo heroics.** Quality, Ops, Sales—all had to align for every shipment.
