## From Intern to Product Manager{.no-anchor}

> **5 ½ years · 3 roles · 1 constant goal:** keep the world’s smallest chips safe on their journey from fab to finished device.

I joined 3M’s **Electronics Material Solutions Division** as an intern, crunched marketing data as an analyst, and ultimately owned the **carrier-tape portfolio** as Product Manager. Along the way I learned how a millimeter-wide strip of plastic can make—or break—an entire semiconductor supply chain.


## Why Carrier Tape Matters{.no-anchor}

Carrier tape sits at the intersection of **precision engineering** and **high-volume automation**:

- **Protects** fragile dies, LEDs, passives from ESD & micro-cracks  
- **Feeds** pick-and-place machines at **> 30 k components/hr**  
- **Enables** wafer-level packaging, mini-LED TVs, and the chips in your phone

Without it, yield drops and production costs spike. Small tape, big impact.


## My Hats (Often Worn All at Once){.no-anchor}


| Area                       | What I Did                                                    |
|----------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Product Ownership**      | Drove roadmap for 3000 & 3200 Series tapes; scoped new cover tape designs with R&D |
| **Product Manager**        | Discuss next-steps to launch new products with R&D manager after a positive evaluation | 
| **Market & Customer Analysis** | Built Power BI dashboard from SAP/Salesforce data to spot volume shifts | 
| **Cross-functional Coordination** | Ran monthly S&OP Meeting with Sales, Ops, Quality | 
| **Technical Support**      | Advised customers on peel-force & suggested cover tape | 
| **Go-to-Market**           | Created demo rigs & content for SEMICON TW Tradeshow | 
| **P&L Owner**              | Review low margin items and discuss action plan with sales team | 


## A Day in the (Tape-Filled) Life{.no-anchor}

**08:30** — Slack stand-up with manufacturing to triage a pocket-depth deviation.  
**10:00** — SQL pull on last quarter’s order mix → see LED segment down **12 %**.  
**13:00** — Customer call; discuss new peel force request for even smaller dies.  
**15:00** — Figma mock of new datasheet; loop in MarCom for compliance.  
**17:00** — Update Jira epics, prep slides for exec read-out.

No two days looked alike—exactly why I loved it.



## Key Takeaways{.no-anchor}

- **Learned to think in systems.** Understanding how a tiny design change could cascade across manufacturing, logistics, and customer experience made me a more strategic product owner. 
- **Turned data into influence.** Building and communicating insights with dashboards strengthened my ability to align diverse teams and drive decisions with credibility.
- **Grew into a cross-functional leader.** Success wasn’t about individual wins—it came from forging strong partnerships across Sales, Ops, R&D, and Quality.
