## 🎧 What *Is* Vibe Coding?{.no-anchor}

Coined by Andrej Karpathy in 2025, **vibe coding** is a style of AI-assisted development where you co-create software through natural language prompts. You describe what you want — layout, logic, behavior — and let the AI generate most of the code. Your job becomes guiding, reviewing, and refining. It's fast. It's iterative. And it's incredibly fun when you're in the zone.

## 🛠️ How I Vibe-Coded This Portfolio{.no-anchor}

When I set out to build this site using **Quarto**, I leaned into vibe coding to bring my ideas to life. Here's how I used prompts + AI to accelerate the entire process.

### 🔁 Prompt → Preview Loops{.no-anchor}

I gave the AI detailed prompts like:

Prompt: "Create a responsive Quarto page with a two-column layout:
Left side for project cards, right side for an About Me section. Add a sticky navbar."

The AI returned 100+ lines of YAML and HTML. My role was to:

- Clean up the structure
- Extract inline CSS into a custom.scss file
- Debug Quarto-specific syntax quirks

### ⚡ Instant Components{.no-anchor}

I used AI to scaffold:

- A vibrant hero section
- A filterable project grid
- An interactive skills accordion

I customized the layout and interactivity using Quarto's chunk options, Bootstrap classes, and SCSS variables.

### 🎨 Rapid Theming{.no-anchor}

To refine the visual identity of my site, I prompt-tuned with design intent:

Prompt: "Make the call-to-action button playful with a pastel palette and rounded corners"

This let me explore multiple design variants in minutes without rewriting all the CSS by hand.

## 📚 What I Learned{.no-anchor}

| 💡 Lesson | Takeaway |
|-----------|----------|
| Prompting is a design skill | Clear context = better code, faster iterations |
| AI isn't always right | Some hallucinated Quarto options needed manual corrections |
| Human + AI = best results | Final polish still relies on UX sense and technical intuition |

## 🧩 Challenges I Faced (and Solved){.no-anchor}

| ❌ Problem | ✅ Solution |
|-----------|----------|
| Code chunks broke layout | Used freeze: true and scoped JS imports carefully |
| Conflicting CSS | Merged class names and offloaded critical styles to custom.scss |
| Mixed audience (Product + Data) | Added filters and tabs to highlight both skill sets separately |

## ✨ Why It Mattered{.no-anchor}

Building this site wasn't just a technical challenge — it was a creative flow state.

It reminded me how AI can boost not only productivity, but also playfulness in the process. This portfolio reflects who I am: a builder who loves clean data, smart design, and continuous learning.
