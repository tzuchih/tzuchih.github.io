Here’s how I used prompts + AI to accelerate the entire process.\n\n🔁 Prompt → Preview Loops\nI gave the AI detailed prompts like:\nPrompt: “Create a responsive Quarto page with a two-column layout: Left side for project cards, right side for an About Me section. Add a sticky navbar.”\nThe AI returned 100+ lines of YAML and HTML. My role was to:\n\nClean up the structure\nExtract inline CSS into a custom.scss file\nDebug Quarto-specific syntax quirks\n\n\n\n⚡ Instant Components\nI used AI to scaffold:\n\nA vibrant hero section\nA filterable project grid\nAn interactive skills accordion\n\nI customized the layout and interactivity using Quarto’s chunk options, Bootstrap classes, and SCSS variables.\n\n\n🎨 Rapid Theming\nTo refine the visual identity of my site, I prompt-tuned with design intent:\nPrompt: “Make the call-to-action button playful with a pastel palette and rounded corners”\nThis let me explore multiple design variants in minutes without rewriting all the CSS by hand."

    "section": "🧠 How It Works Behind the Scenes",
    "text": "🧠 How It Works Behind the Scenes\n\n1. Resume Parsing\nUsers upload a resume (PDF or DOCX), and I use pdfminer and python-docx to extract raw text. This ensures the system can handle a wide range of formatting.\n\n\n2. Text Preprocessing\nA custom clean_text() function prepares the text by:\n\nLowercasing all characters\nRemoving numbers and punctuation\nTokenizing the text\nRemoving stopwords with NLTK\nLemmatizing each token\n\nThis helps standardize the content from both resumes and job descriptions.\n\n\n3. Data Preparation\nEach job posting is processed by merging its title and required skills into one text field, which then undergoes the same cleaning pipeline for consistency.\n\n\n4. TF-IDF Vectorization\nI apply TF-IDF with bi-grams, sublinear term frequency, and smoothing to convert the cleaned text into numerical vectors. This approach highlights important skills and phrases while minimizing noise.\ndef get_vectorizer_and_vectors(job_data):\n    \"\"\"Caches the TF-IDF vectorizer and job text embeddings.\"\"\"\n    vectorizer = TfidfVectorizer(stop_words='english', ngram_range=(1,2), smooth_idf=True, sublinear_tf=True)\n    \n    if not job_data.empty:\n        job_vectors = vectorizer.fit_transform(job_data['clean_text'])\n    else:\n        job_vectors = None  # Prevents errors if no jobs exist\n    \n    return vectorizer, job_vectors\n\n\n5. Cosine Similarity Matching\nThe resume vector is compared against all job vectors using cosine similarity, generating a match score. To improve interpretability, I normalize the similarity scores to a 0–100 scale.\n\n\n6. Filtering Options\nUsers can filter jobs by:\n🌎 Country, 💼 Job Level, 🏠 Job Type (Onsite, Remote, or Hybrid)\nOnly filtered jobs are vectorized—making the system both efficient and responsive.\n\n\n7. Skill Gap Analysis\nEach job match also includes:\n✅ Matched Skills you already have\n❌ Missing Skills to work on\nThis makes recommendations actionable for job seekers.\n\n\n8. Cover Letter Generator\nSelect a job, click a button, and the system drafts a personalized cover letter based on the role, skills, and company—great for quickly tailoring applications."
